##  About this Repository  
This repository documents my **4-week internship journey at Excelerate** as a Data Analyst Trainee.  
Along with my teammates in **Team-09**, I worked on transforming messy raw data into meaningful insights through **cleaning, analysis, visualization, and storytelling dashboards**.  

- The journey was structured into **four key weeks**:  
  1. Data Cleaning & Preparation  
  2. Visualization Best Practices  
  3. Campaign Insights & Recommendations  
  4. Final Dashboard & Presentation

## Week 1: Cleaning & Preparing Data  

The first step in our journey was to **make the dataset reliable and analysis-ready**.  
We focused on:  
- Handling **missing values**  
- Removing **duplicate records** (>500 identified and dropped)  
- Standardizing **date, text, and numeric formats**  
- Filtering **outliers**  
- Building a **master table** for analysis  

- **My Contribution:** I worked on spotting duplicate rows, aligning inconsistent formats, and ensuring that our master dataset was free from irregularities.  

- **Outcome:** By the end of Week 1, we created a **clean dataset with 10+ features standardized** and free from noise, forming the foundation for meaningful analysis.  

---

## Week 2: Data Foundation & Preparation
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation :** I performed a full-scale data cleaning operation on the raw dataset. This involved converting messy, text-based financial columns (e.g., â‚¹1,092.24) into a numerical format, ensuring data consistency for reliable analysis.

- **Feature Engineering:** I created a new, crucial metric: **Cost Per Thousand Impressions (CPM)**. This metric was essential for measuring the cost-effectiveness of our brand's ad exposure.

- **Validation:** I validated the data for missing values and logical inconsistencies, ensuring the dataset was ready for a robust analysis.

-  **My Contribution:** I refined graphs to remove unnecessary clutter and applied direct labeling + highlighting to make campaign performance easier to understand for non-technical viewers.  

-  **Outcome:** Visuals became **simpler, more storytelling-driven**, and easy for stakeholders to interpret at a glance.  

------------------

## Week 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Dashboarding
- **Strategic Analysis:** I conducted an in-depth exploratory data analysis to uncover key business insights, focusing on audience performance, geographical impact, and cost efficiency.

- **Dashboard Design:** I designed and developed a comprehensive, two-page dashboard using Google Looker Studio to visualize our findings. The dashboard was structured for different stakeholders:
- **Page 1:**
    -  Performance Summary â€” Focused on a high-level overview of key metrics like Reach, Impressions, and Unique Link Clicks.

_________
**Page 2:**
  - Strategic Insights â€” Focused on deeper, more analytical relationships like CPR trends and the relationship between Frequency and CTR (ad fatigue analysis).

- **My Contribution:** I helped compare **CPC, CPR, CTR, and reach metrics**, and identified which campaigns were draining budget and which deserved more investment.  
-  **Impact:** Our insights highlighted a potential **95% budget optimization opportunity** by shifting funds from high-cost to low-cost campaigns.  

### Key Numerical Insights & Recommendations
- My analysis provided several critical insights that directly led to actionable business recommendations:
  - **Audience Performance:** The Students audience was our most successful, driving a massive **4,379** unique link clicks, proving our core targeting strategy was highly effective.
  
  - **Cost Efficiency:** I discovered a significant difference in campaign efficiency. **Campaign 8** was our most cost-effective, with a remarkably low **â‚¹0.99 Cost per Result (CPR).**
  
  - **Budget Optimization:** Based on the data, I provided a clear recommendation to discontinue underperforming campaigns with a **high CPR**, such as **Campaign 11 (â‚¹21.57 CPR)**.
  
  - **Resource Reallocation:** I recommended reallocating the budget from these inefficient campaigns to our top performers (like **Campaign 8**) to maximize our overall **ROI**.
-----------
## Week 4: Finalization & Strategic Communication
- **Actionable Insights:** I summarized the most critical insights from my analysis into clear, concise findings.

- **Presentation & Storytelling:** I crafted content for a PowerPoint presentation that communicated the project's journey, from problem statement to final recommendations. This included translating complex charts into simple, human-friendly narratives.

- **Professional Communication:** I developed a high-reach, engaging LinkedIn post to professionally showcase the project, sharing key insights and lessons learned to a wider audience.
--------------

 ### **My Contribution:**  
- Designed **chart explanations** and ensured filters worked intuitively.  
- Drafted insights for the **20-slide presentation**.  
- Connected Week 1 (clean data) â†’ Week 2 (clear visuals) â†’ Week 3 (insights) â†’ Week 4 (storytelling dashboard).  

 - **Outcome:** A dashboard + presentation that turned raw campaign data into a **decision-support tool** for maximizing ROI.
