## ðŸ—‚ Week 1: Cleaning & Preparing Data  

The first step in our journey was to **make the dataset reliable and analysis-ready**.  
We focused on:  
- Handling **missing values**  
- Removing **duplicate records** (>500 identified and dropped)  
- Standardizing **date, text, and numeric formats**  
- Filtering **outliers**  
- Building a **master table** for analysis  

âœ¨ **My Contribution:** I worked on spotting duplicate rows, aligning inconsistent formats, and ensuring that our master dataset was free from irregularities.  

âœ… **Outcome:** By the end of Week 1, we created a **clean dataset with 10+ features standardized** and free from noise, forming the foundation for meaningful analysis.  

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Week 2: Visualization Best Practices  

Once the data was clean, we moved to **designing clear and impactful visualizations**.  
Instead of making complex, crowded visuals, we learned to:  
- **Simplify** charts for clarity  
- **Emphasize** important points with highlights  
- **Annotate** insights directly on visuals  
- **Label charts directly** to reduce reliance on legends  

âœ¨ **My Contribution:** I refined graphs to remove unnecessary clutter and applied direct labeling + highlighting to make campaign performance easier to understand for non-technical viewers.  

âœ… **Outcome:** Visuals became **simpler, more storytelling-driven**, and easy for stakeholders to interpret at a glance.

## ðŸ“ˆ Week 3: Campaign Insights & Recommendations  

This was the **analysis-heavy week** where we broke down campaign performance across geographies.  

ðŸ”Ž **Key Insights:**  
- Campaign 3 (Australia) and Campaign 10 (UK) â†’ **High cost, low results** (up to â‚¹18.51 per result).  
- Campaign 8 (Nigeria) â†’ **Most efficient** (~â‚¹0.88 per result, with CTR ~10.9%).  
- Campaign 2 & 6 (Students in Group 2 countries + India) â†’ Strong engagement, large reach.  

âœ¨ **My Contribution:** I helped compare **CPC, CPR, CTR, and reach metrics**, and identified which campaigns were draining budget and which deserved more investment.  

âœ… **Recommendation:**  
- Pause underperforming campaigns (3 & 10).  
- Reallocate budget to efficient ones (2, 6, 8).  
- Optimize ad creatives for high-engagement regions.  

ðŸ’¡ **Impact:** Our insights highlighted a potential **95% budget optimization opportunity** by shifting funds from high-cost to low-cost campaigns.

## ðŸ“Š Week 4: Final Dashboard & Presentation  

The final week was about **bringing everything together into an interactive dashboard and presentation**.  
We used Looker Studio to build a **live dashboard** that:  
- Showed **KPIs** (CPC, CTR, CPR, Reach, Impressions)  
- Allowed **filtering by country & campaign type**  
- Highlighted **cost vs engagement patterns**  
- Enabled **drill-down analysis** for decision-making  

âœ¨ **My Contribution:**  
- Designed **chart explanations** and ensured filters worked intuitively.  
- Drafted insights for the **12-slide presentation**.  
- Connected Week 1 (clean data) â†’ Week 2 (clear visuals) â†’ Week 3 (insights) â†’ Week 4 (storytelling dashboard).  

âœ… **Outcome:** A dashboard + presentation that turned raw campaign data into a **decision-support tool** for maximizing ROI.
